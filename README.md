## Description of Functionalities

This repository includes several Java programs that showcase the use of variables, operators, conditionals, loops, and input handling. The key functionalities covered in the exercises are:

- **Console-based user interaction** using `Scanner` for reading input
- **Purchase calculators and arithmetic logic** to simulate basic operations
- **Number analysis and conditional structures** to evaluate user input
- **Menu-driven programs** to demonstrate control flow and decision-making
- **Modular exercises** organized by class sessions to support progressive learning

Each `.java` file represents a standalone activity aimed at reinforcing core Java concepts through practical implementation.


## Objective

To practically learn the basic concepts of programming in Java and understand how they can be applied to real-world problems.
This module serves as the foundation for advanced backend development and AI-enhanced Java practices.

## How to Use This Repository

You can clone it to interact with the exercises via the console or a user interface.

## Status

‚úîÔ∏è Module 1 completed. Exercises are organized by class sessions.
